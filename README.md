## How to use

Using this language aint that deep. Printing is done with the `prnt` keyword.

```
prnt "Hello World!"
prnt 8323
prnt variable_name
```

To use variables, you must firstly define them. `defn` defines a variable.

```
defn var_A
defn var_B
defn var_C
```

Variables have an inital value that is literally their name. Defining a variable `hjgjj` and trying to print it without altering it will just print `hjgjj`

Altering variables is done with `altv`.

```
altv var_A set 3
altv var_A add 9
altv var_A sub 4
```

These are the possible operators you can use:
```
add - adds number to variable
sub - subtracts number from variable
div - divides variable by number
mul - multiplies variable by number

set - sets variable to a certain value
del - deletes variable
```

## Note
There isn't much more than this for now. And I dont think I will add anything new to this as it will require a full rework of the interpretation. This, is good enough for now. I'd rather start anew than add upon this tbh.
